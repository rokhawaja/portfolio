        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                NoteSight is an AI-powered attendance and classroom analytics platform designed to help teachers 
                and school administrators automate attendance tracking and gain visibility into student engagement 
                and performance trends. The platform transforms a tedious manual process into a seamless, 
                data-driven experience that empowers educators to make better decisions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Manual attendance tracking was slow, error-prone, and produced no actionable data. Teachers spent 
                valuable class time on administrative tasks, and administrators had no easy way to see attendance 
                patterns across classes or correlate them with student performance. When a student started falling 
                behind, there was no early warning system in place.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>5–10 minutes of class time lost per session on manual attendance</li>
                <li>No visibility into attendance trends or at-risk students</li>
                <li>Error-prone paper-based or manual digital systems</li>
                <li>No correlation between attendance patterns and academic performance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- My Role -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                As both Product Manager and Product Designer, I owned the end-to-end product experience from 
                discovery through delivery.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Led product discovery through interviews with teachers, teaching assistants, and administrators</li>
                <li>Conducted workflow mapping to understand existing attendance and reporting processes</li>
                <li>Designed end-to-end user flows for taking attendance, viewing dashboards, and flagging at-risk students</li>
                <li>Created low-fidelity wireframes through high-fidelity interactive prototypes</li>
                <li>Wrote core product specs and collaborated closely with developers on implementation</li>
                <li>Ran usability testing sessions and iterated based on educator feedback</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Process -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>

            <h3>Research & Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                I started by interviewing 12+ educators across different school types to understand their daily workflows. 
                Key insights included: teachers wanted attendance to take less than 30 seconds, administrators needed 
                weekly trend reports without manual data compilation, and everyone wanted a system that worked equally 
                well on desktop and tablet.
            </p>

            <h3>User Flows & Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                I mapped out the primary user journeys — from a teacher opening the app to mark attendance in under 
                30 seconds, to an administrator reviewing weekly absence reports and identifying students who may need 
                outreach. These flows informed the navigation structure and feature prioritization.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
            <p>
                Starting with low-fidelity sketches and moving to interactive Figma prototypes, I designed the core 
                experiences: the quick-capture attendance flow, the teacher dashboard, and the admin analytics view. 
                Each iteration was tested with educators to validate usability.
            </p>

        </div>

        <!-- Solution -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
                The final product delivers three core experiences designed to work seamlessly across desktop and tablet:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI-assisted attendance capture:</strong> Recognition-based or quick checklist flows that reduce attendance to a few taps</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time dashboards:</strong> Attendance trends, at-risk student flags, and classroom-level insights updated automatically</li>
                <li><strong>Simple, responsive UX:</strong> Clean interface that works equally well on desktop for administrators and tablet for classroom use</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

                    <h4>Earlier Intervention</h4>
                    <p>Provided teachers with actionable insights to identify and reach out to at-risk students earlier</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Learnings -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>
                Working on NoteSight reinforced the importance of designing for the real context of use. Teachers 
                need tools that fit into the first 30 seconds of class, not tools that demand a separate workflow. 
                By spending time in classrooms and watching how attendance actually happens, I was able to design 
                flows that felt natural rather than imposed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also learned how crucial dashboard UX is when users have limited time to interpret data. Every 
                chart, metric, and flag had to communicate its meaning instantly — because an administrator reviewing 
                reports doesn't have time to figure out what a visualization means.
            </p>
