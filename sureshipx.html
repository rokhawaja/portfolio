        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                SureShipX is a logistics and fulfillment platform used by e-commerce brands to manage shipments, 
                tracking, and operations across markets. It integrates with couriers and ERPs to automate status 
                updates, tracking notifications, and operational workflows — giving merchants a single source of 
                truth for their entire logistics operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Founder and Product Owner, I was responsible for the product vision, the UX of every 
                customer-facing and internal interface, and the collaboration with engineers to bring it all to life.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                E-commerce merchants juggle multiple courier integrations, inconsistent tracking updates, and 
                fragmented tools that make it nearly impossible to maintain visibility over their shipments. 
                The result: frustrated customers flooding support channels with "Where is my order?" queries, 
                operational blind spots, and missed SLA commitments.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Merchants lacked a unified view of shipments across multiple courier partners</li>
                <li>Tracking updates were delayed or inconsistent, causing customer anxiety</li>
                <li>Support teams were overwhelmed with WISMO (Where Is My Order) tickets</li>
                <li>Logistics teams had no efficient way to handle exceptions and errors at scale</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Research -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                I conducted in-depth interviews with e-commerce merchants, logistics managers, and support teams 
                to understand the end-to-end fulfillment experience. Key findings shaped the product direction:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Merchants needed real-time shipment visibility with clear exception handling</li>
                <li>Customer-facing tracking pages needed to be branded and informative to reduce support load</li>
                <li>Logistics operators needed scan-based workflows that minimize manual data entry</li>
                <li>The biggest pain point was not knowing about problems until the customer complained</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- UX Process -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>UX Process</h2>

            <h3>Information Architecture & User Flows</h3>
            <p>
                I mapped out the workflows for three primary user types: merchants managing orders, logistics operators 
                processing shipments, and end customers tracking packages. Each flow was designed to surface the most 
                critical information first and reduce clicks to common actions.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframing & Iteration</h3>
            <p>
                I designed wireframes for the shipment tracking dashboard, order management views, customer tracking 
                pages, and operational scan-based flows. Each was iterated based on merchant feedback and operational 
                constraints discovered during pilot testing.
            </p>


            <h3>Key UX & Product Contributions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shipment tracking dashboard</strong> with clear status indicators and exception flags</li>
                <li><strong>Order management view</strong> with filters, bulk actions, and SLA indicators</li>
                <li><strong>Customer tracking page</strong> designs that reduce support queries by providing proactive updates</li>
                <li><strong>Operational workflows</strong> for logistics teams including scan-based flows and error handling</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <!-- Final Designs -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Final Designs</h2>
            <p>
                The production designs deliver a clean, data-dense interface that balances information density with 
                clarity. The merchant dashboard surfaces shipment status at a glance, while drill-down views provide 
                the detail needed for exception handling. The customer-facing tracking page was designed to be branded, 
                mobile-first, and informative enough to preempt support tickets.

        <!-- Learnings -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>
                Building SureShipX taught me that in logistics, the most impactful UX work often happens in the 
                exception paths — not the happy paths. When a shipment is on track, the interface barely needs to 
                exist. But when something goes wrong, the design needs to surface the problem, explain it clearly, 
                and make resolution effortless.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also learned the importance of designing for operational speed. Warehouse teams and logistics 
                operators don't have time for complex interfaces — every extra click costs real money at scale. 
                This drove me to design scan-based flows and keyboard-first interactions that minimize friction.
            </p>
