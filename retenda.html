        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Retenda is a SaaS tool that helps digital products increase engagement and retention using 
                AI-driven reminders, journeys, and feedback loops. It gives product teams a clear view of 
                what's working, what's not, and what to do next — all within a simple, actionable interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Product Manager and UX Lead, I defined the feature set, created user personas and journeys, 
                and designed the end-to-end experience from onboarding through daily use.

        <!-- Problem -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Most digital products struggle with retention — they acquire users but can't keep them engaged. 
                Product teams often lack visibility into why users churn and don't have an easy way to set up 
                targeted re-engagement campaigns. Existing tools are either too complex (requiring dedicated 
                analytics teams) or too simplistic (basic push notifications with no intelligence).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product teams couldn't easily identify at-risk users or understand churn patterns</li>
                <li>Setting up retention campaigns required technical expertise and multiple tools</li>
                <li>No clear connection between retention actions and measurable outcomes</li>
                <li>Existing solutions were either enterprise-complex or consumer-simplistic</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Research -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                I conducted interviews with product managers, growth leads, and founders at early-stage SaaS 
                companies to understand how they currently approach retention. Key insights included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teams wanted a "retention dashboard" that shows cohort performance at a glance</li>
                <li>Most were doing retention work manually — spreadsheets, ad-hoc emails, gut-feel decisions</li>
                <li>The ideal tool would suggest what to do, not just show data</li>
                <li>Onboarding needed to be fast — teams wanted to see value within the first session</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>
                I created three primary personas: the Growth PM who needs cohort analytics and campaign tools, 
                the Founder who needs a quick overview of retention health, and the Marketing Lead who wants 
                to schedule targeted reminders and campaigns.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- UX Process -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>UX Process</h2>

            <h3>Onboarding Design</h3>
            <p>
                I designed an onboarding flow that configures retention journeys in just a few steps — connect 
                your data source, define your key retention events, and Retenda starts building your first 
                retention dashboard automatically. The goal was to deliver an "aha moment" within 5 minutes.
            </p>


            <h3>Dashboard & Insights</h3>
            <p>
                The main dashboard shows retention metrics, cohort performance, and AI-generated suggestions 
                in a single view. I designed the information hierarchy so that the most actionable insights 
                are always visible above the fold, with drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis.
            </p>


            <h3>Campaign & Reminder Builder</h3>
            <p>
                I designed interfaces for scheduling reminders and campaigns with clear previews — so teams 
                can see exactly what their users will receive before it goes live. The builder supports 
                conditional logic and timing rules while keeping the UI approachable for non-technical users.
            </p>

        </div>

        <!-- Learnings -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>
                Retenda taught me that the best analytics tools don't just show data — they tell you what to do 
                with it. Every screen I designed had to answer two questions: "What's happening?" and "What should 
                I do about it?" This principle shaped the entire product experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also learned the value of progressive disclosure in complex tools. By starting users with a 
                simple dashboard and only revealing advanced features as they become relevant, we dramatically 
                reduced the learning curve and increased activation rates during early testing.
            </p>
